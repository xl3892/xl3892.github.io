						Apple promotes its products in many different ways and forms, namely through commercials and advertisements to emphasize the brand image and quality of its products. Apple's ads stand out especially from its competitors because like its product, its promotions also follow a simple and minimal aesthetic. This allows the audience to differentiate and focus on this company only.
