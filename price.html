                        Apple uses the premium pricing strategy, which offers its products at high prices. For instance, iPhones are generally more expensive than the other smartphones in the market. It also rarely drops prices in order to lay off on competitions with these other companies. This prevents a race to the bottom and not profiting. Besides that, Apple also uses the freemium pricing strategy. Combining the terms "free" and “premium,” it offers a free product with a purchase of one of its other products. For example, the free apps that come with Apple, may require in-app purchases, in order to grant better user experience and additional content.
