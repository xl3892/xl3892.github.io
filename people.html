						Apple was founded by Steve Jobs back in 1976, 45 years ago. He said, "people don't know what they want until we show it to them." This demonstrates how Jobs' initial intention was the people, which is why people may choose Apple over others. Its simplicity allows people to easily access information and tools. Nowadays, we can see a bunch of employees in navy blue tops at the Apple Store, helping people out with lots of patience and knowledge about their product. This leaves a good impression with thier consumers and continues this by their constomer service online.
