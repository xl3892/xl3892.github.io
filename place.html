						In order to ensure distribution to their consumers, Apple only authorizes certain stores and parties to sell their products in addition to the Apple Store. The Apple Store is currently available in over 500 locations at major cities all over the world and online for everyone. Apple products are also distributed in some of the biggest telecommunication companies like AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. This allows more people to see Apple and potentially purchase their products because of the carrier.
